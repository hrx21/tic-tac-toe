Tic Tac Toe is a game, we all love and played in childhood so i made a Tic Tac Toe digital game.
This game is made with Vanilla JavaScript.
And for designing and other stuff I have used CSS and some HTML.
Game consists of a column with 9 squares in it first serves X then O. At the end result is displayed as e.g. X Wins!
